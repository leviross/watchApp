   <h4>ClockSwap.com is a market place for customers to sell their watches to a dedicated following of watch connoisseurs.</h4>
   <p>Our site is about the love and passion for mechanical timepieces and a deep appreciation of the history of clocks and watches.</p>
   <p>A major stimulus to improving the accuracy and reliability of clocks was the importance of precise time-keeping for navigation. The position of a ship at sea could be determined with reasonable accuracy if a navigator could refer to a clock that lost or gained less than about 10 seconds per day. This clock could not contain a pendulum, which would be virtually useless on a rocking ship. In 1714, the British government offered a large prize to the value of 20,000 pounds,for anyone who could determine longitude accurately after the Scilly naval disaster of 1707. The reward was eventually claimed in 1761 by John Harrison, who dedicated his life to improving the accuracy of his clocks.</p>
   <p>In 1735, Harrison built his first chronometer, which he steadily improved on over the next thirty years before submitting it for examination. The clock had many innovations, including the use of bearings to reduce friction, weighted balances to compensate for the ship's pitch and roll in the sea and the use of two different metals to reduce the problem of expansion from heat.
   The chronometer was tested in 1761 by Harrison's son and by the end of 10 weeks the clock was in error by less than 5 seconds</p>
   <p>Marine chronometers are the forefathers of wrist watches. They helped shape the world through providing an accurate reading of a ship's longitude. In a digital world, it is so important to maintain a sense of appreciation for the art of time.</p>
   <h4>We care about our customers and want them to have fun on our site.</h4>
   <p>ClockSwap was built by a group of watch collectors who have years of experience in the industry and love to promote their favorite brands. Its not the brand that matters, but what that brand represents with it's history.</p>
   <p>Our sellers have been properly confirmed and all our watches our 100% authentic and original. We do not deal with replica watches whatsoever and will refund any purchase if is is found to be a replica watch.</p>
